# Astro Bot refactor readme

Open source discord bot Astro project 

## Deploy and testing
    1. Set token - obtainable from discord dev portal
    2. ``npm run start`` - to start the app

    With replit as hosting bot started crashing a lot - we also reached limits for its database capacity so its good time for a refactor and change it to independend instance.

    Biggest problem with refactor is change key-value storage used in replit which requires a lot of changes
